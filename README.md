# A New Timer/Trainer
I'm sure that all cubers have heard of the site Cstimer. What this project is doing is it is going to be a better cstimer, with tutorials, a page that measures your tps, an algometer like j perm's, and much more. I'm seeing if a few people are intersted in doing this project with me. If you want to join put a file in the repository that says that you are joining.
